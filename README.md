# YAGE: Yet Another Game Engine

This is personal project made in order to learn and use SDL3 and Makefiles.

Here are a list of resources this is based off of:

* https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/
* https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3_image/
* https://makefiletutorial.com/
* https://michaelmacha.wordpress.com/2024/12/13/sdl3-in-c/

You'll need Make and gcc installed to build this project.
